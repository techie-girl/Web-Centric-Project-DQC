CSCI 3172 – Web-Centric Computing

We aim to solve the scheduling problem with group collaboration of academic projects amongst students. Our web-based application will provide a week’s view of free blocks of time between two or more students in a group. We will take into consideration common obstacles of group collaboration, such as, exclusion and inclusion of group member schedules, scheduling viewing permissions among group members, and location tracking features.
